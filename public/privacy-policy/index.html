<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>


<p>Our approach to privacy is pretty straightforward—we avoid collecting private information if we don&rsquo;t have to, and if we do, we respect and protect it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important, however, to consider the difference between private and anonymous data.</p>

<h2 id="anonymous-data">Anonymous data</h2>

<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>

<p>We use <a href="http://www.google.ca/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/guides/metrics-faq">Squarespace Metrics</a> to get an idea of how and why people visit this website. These services collect anonymous data to determine where website traffic is coming from, and where it goes.</p>

<p>None of the reports generated from data collected by these services are personally identifying. In other words, there&rsquo;s no way for us to know exactly who is visiting the site—the data are anonymous and aggregate. And that&rsquo;s the way we want to keep it.</p>

<p>You can review these companies&rsquo; privacy policies at the following links:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245">Google Analytics</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.squarespace.com/privacy/">Squarespace</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="affiliate-marketing">Affiliate marketing</h3>

<p>We also sometimes use affiliate links to the App Store, known as <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/faq_en.html">the Affiliate Program</a>. Visiting one of these links will anonymously track purchases you may make on the App Store or iTunes Store, for a 24-hour hour period, on the device that you were using when you opened the link.</p>

<p>You can review the terms and conditions that govern our use of the Affiliate Program <a href="http://www.performancehorizon.com/docs/itunes/terms/en.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="private-data">Private data</h2>

<p>We do, in some circumstances, collect some personal data.</p>

<p>Specifically, if you send us an e-mail, we&rsquo;ll keep a record of your e-mail address, as well as the communication you had with us, in some form or another. We do this because it&rsquo;s really hard to reply to you without this information, and because whatever comments and questions you have may help us make better products for you.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you post a comment on a news article, whatever information you share will be publicly available to other users of the website, as well as other third parties.</p>

<p>Your e-mail address will never shared be with anyone without your permission. Period.</p>

<p>Well, there&rsquo;s one exception: if we&rsquo;re required by law to share this information, we will, but only after a careful review of the request with our lawyers.</p>

<p>We do not receive any of your information (e.g. name, credit card number, billing address, etc.) from Apple when you make a purchase from the App Store, nor do we have any idea who submits reviews of our apps.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-tracking">Third-party tracking</h2>

<p>This website uses so-called &ldquo;social sharing&rdquo; buttons for your convenience in sharing some pages or news articles. Clicking on one of these buttons will result in your action being tracked by a third party (e.g. Google+, Twitter, &amp;cet.). We have no control over this, but you can always turn off this kind of tracking by turning off third-party cookies in your browser(s).</p>

<h2 id="living-document">Living document</h2>

<p>This privacy policy is a living document and may change over time to reflect new features and options that we decide to offer (e.g. newsletters, online store, etc.); any time we do so, we&rsquo;ll let you know via the <a href="http://www.droppedbits.com/news/">news page</a>.</p>
