    <h1>Per is the easiest, fastest way to compare price while you shop.</h1>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/per-shop-smart.-save-money./id922693504?ls=1&amp;mt=8"><img class="appstore center" src="/images/appstore-black.svg" alt="Download Per on the App Store"></a>
    

<p>Per helps you shop smarter by figuring out what gets you more for your money.</p>

<p>At its heart, Per is a price-per-unit calculator. Just give it the price and quantity for two options, tap the Compare button, and let Per figure out which one gives you the best deal.</p>

<p>Of course, you can do that kind of math with a basic calculator app. Per brings a few neat little tricks to the comparison-shopping party, though.</p>

<h3 id="bang-for-your-buck">Bang for your buck.</h3>

<p><img class="halfwidth center" src="/images/Per/bang-for-buck.png" alt="Image of Per result indicating how much more you get for your money with the winning option."></p>

<p>Just because you&rsquo;re getting more for your money, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s a good buy.</p>

<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re not sure you&rsquo;ve got the space to store eighty rolls of toilet paper.</p>

<p>Or that you can get through sixteen heads of lettuce before they spoil.</p>

<p>Per tells you just how much more you&rsquo;re getting for your money, so you can make those decisions confidently.</p>

<h3 id="convert-between-units">Convert between units.</h3>

<p><img class="halfwidth center" src="/images/Per/unit-conversion.gif" alt="Animated image showing Per's built-in unit conversion."></p>

<p>Making a decision between two options is even more annoying when they&rsquo;re in different units. Millilitres versus fluid ounces. Grams versus pounds. And so on.</p>

<p>Maybe you have a conversion app to help. Maybe you rely on your search engine.</p>

<p>Or maybe you can let Per simplify your grocery run.</p>

<p>Just select the type of unit (weight or volume), and then choose the units for each product. Tap Compare, and Per will sort out all the details for you.</p>

<h3 id="forget-the-calculator">Forget the calculator.</h3>

<p><img class="halfwidth center" src="/images/Per/math.gif" alt="Animated image showing Per's in-line calculator"></p>

<p>Coupons?</p>

<p>Buy two, get one free?</p>

<p>Double rolls?</p>

<p>Per&rsquo;s input toolbar lets you enter simple equations, so that you never have to switch to your calculator app. Just plug in the math, and the calculation is updated automatically.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3 id="in-my-area-retailers-are-required-by-law-to-indicate-the-price-per-unit-why-would-i-need-per">In my area, retailers are required by law to indicate the price per unit. Why would I need Per?</h3>

<p>These laws don&rsquo;t always require the vendor to use a common unit for easy comparison, and they also may not apply to sale-price items. And when you&rsquo;re looking at what amounts to fractions of a penny per unit, it&rsquo;s hard to tell exactly how good a deal that price may be. Per&rsquo;s features help in all of these cases.</p>

<h3 id="per-s-unit-conversion-isn-t-exactly-accurate">Per&rsquo;s unit conversion isn&rsquo;t exactly accurate.</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s not exactly a question, but it is a good point.</p>

<p>You have to strike a balance between accuracy and practicality. While 16 fluid ounces are equal to 473.176473 mL, you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find any packaging facility that can actually meet this kind of precision, so Per uses the more commonly-accepted 473 mL conversion instead, because this will give a more useful and realistic unit-price result.</p>

<h3 id="does-per-s-conversion-feature-handle-uk-measurement-units">Does Per&rsquo;s conversion feature handle UK measurement units?</h3>

<p>Yes! You&rsquo;re prompted to select the type of non-metric units when you first launch the app (US vs UK) for the region you&rsquo;re in. You can change this at any time by tapping the info button and changing your selection.</p>

<h3 id="why-can-t-i-enter-complex-equations-like-7-25-6-3">Why can&rsquo;t I enter complex equations, like 7 × 25 + 6 ÷ 3?</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bit complicated to make this work in a way that people expect, due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations">operator precedence</a> in mathematics. I&rsquo;m working on an enhancement for this, but in the meanwhile, you can always enter a first equation (7 × 25), go to another input field, then go back and enter the next part of the equation (+ 6), and so on.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-see-the-first-launch-tutorial-again">How can I see the first-launch tutorial again?</h3>

<p>Tap the i at the bottom-right of the main view, and then tap Show the tutorial.</p>

<h3 id="i-have-a-question-not-covered-here">I have a question not covered here.</h3>

<p>You should definitely get in touch via <a href="/contact-us">e-mail</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/Dropped_Bits">Twitter</a> and let me know how I can help.</p>
