      <description>HoneyJar is a future-value calculator inspired by one of Aesop&amp;rsquo;s fables:
 A jar of honey was upset and the sticky sweetness flowed out on the table. The sweet smell of the honey soon brought a large number of Flies buzzing around. They did not wait for an invitation. No, indeed; they settled right down, feet and all, to gorge themselves. The Flies were quickly smeared from head to foot with honey.</description>

      <description>Per helps you shop smarter by figuring out what gets you more for your money.
At its heart, Per is a price-per-unit calculator. Just give it the price and quantity for two options, tap the Compare button, and let Per figure out which one gives you the best deal.
Of course, you can do that kind of math with a basic calculator app. Per brings a few neat little tricks to the comparison-shopping party, though.</description>
