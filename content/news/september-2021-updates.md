Hello, friends!

If you’ve been reading these regularly, you might have noticed that there was no first-Wednesday-of-the-month post last week, nor was there a mid-month update in September. There are two reasons for that.

First, there hasn't been much to report. September was pretty quiet, aside from releasing a very early, mostly-incomplete version of [Per][per]'s redesign to internal testers.

Second, I've decided it makes sense to send out just one update a month. Most of my time goes towards consulting work (gotta pay the bills, after all!), with only a couple of hours a week set aside for working on my own apps, dealing with Business Stuff&trade;, and writing these updates—so from now on, I'll be writing a single update on the 15<sup>th</sup> of every month.

And hey, today _is_ the 15th, so here you go!

## September In Review

[Thought Detox][tdsite] v2021.05 was released on September 3<sup>rd</sup>, and the update focused mainly on translating the app to French and making a few minor design changes. The app's "Back To School" sale continued from the end of August through to the 12<sup>th</sup> of September, but it didn't really generate any sales.

Here’s what the download numbers looked like for September:

- Per: 3 downloads (no change)
- Thought Detox: 0 downloads (-100% ▽)

Revenues and proceeds on sales are estimates based on the information I get from Apple, in US Dollars.

- App Sales (what customers paid Apple): USD$0.00
- App Proceeds (what Apple pays me): USD$0.00

Now that consulting income is making the business profitable, I've decided against continuing to include monthly expenses in these updates — frankly, for expenses like software, it can be a bit tricky to determine if it should count against app revenues or consulting fees, so it doesn't really add value to include it.

## App Updates

### Thought Detox

There's not a whole lot going on with Thought Detox lately. Sales are pretty low, but then I haven't been doing much to market the app at all, so that's not entirely unexpected. I still want to bring the app to iPad (and maybe even macOS), but I'm setting it aside temporarily to work on Per.

If you need a private place to work through negative thoughts, consider getting [Thought Detox on the App Store][tdappstore].

### Per

The redesign of Per is, as I mentioned above, underway. The designer I’m working with has some really solid ideas on product features, and I’m loving the new look we’re bringing to an app that:

1. hasn’t had an update in over five years, and
2. didn’t look all that great to begin with.

The new version of Per will be a free upgrade with an IAP purchase to unlock some new, premium features. I don’t really have a timeline for it, but I’ll be sharing more here and on [the Dropped Bits Twitter feed][dbtwitter] as progress is made.

In the meanwhile, you can [download the original version on the App Store][perappstore].

## One More Thing

The Dropped Bits website needs some love, especially the blog. For now I'll be making a couple of little fixes for visual and navigation bugs, and eventually probably re-write the thing — or perhaps just move it (back) over to a hosting platform.

Anyhow, if anything breaks, [do let me know][mailto]!
