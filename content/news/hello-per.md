_Pop quiz, hotshot:_ you're in produce section at the supermarket, and you need carrots for tonight's dinner.

Raw carrots are $1.09 per pound. Washed baby carrots are $1.99 for 907 grams.

What do you do?

_WHAT DO YOU DO?_

[Per](/apps/per) was created to answer exactly that question. It was inspired by my wife, who literally turned to me at the grocery store and said,

> "You should write an app that tells me which of these options is a better deal. Also, you're very handsome, and have a fantastic sense of humour."

Flattery being my weakness, work began. Three months later, I'm happy to say: Per is now [available on the App Store][download].

Sure, you can use any calculator to compare unit price, but Per adds a few neat little features for your comparison-shopping pleasure:

- Convert between units: Just tell Per what units each options is in, and it'll sort out the conversion for you. Easy.
- Enter math directly: No need to do math in your head or switch over to other apps. Use Per's math toolbar and let it do the calculation for you.
- Know how good the deal is: Per tells you just how much more you're getting for your money, so that you can decide if it's worth the purchase.

[Download Per now][download], shop smarter, and save money. I think you'll love it.
