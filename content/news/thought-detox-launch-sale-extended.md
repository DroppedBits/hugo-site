It's official! Thought Detox is available for [sale on the App Store][1], and to celebrate, I'm extending the sale price.

The [official website][2] also went live Sunday night. Many thanks to Christina Szilbereisz for her work on the design â€” I'm really thrilled with how it turned out!

I haven't seen a _tonne_ of downloads yet, but nonetheless, Thought Detox has done way better on launch than other apps I've released, which I'm really thrilled about. As of this morning, it's 14th [on Product Hunt][3] with 150 upvotes, is in the top 100 Health & Fitness apps, _and_ got its first five-star rating on the App Store. Thank you all for your support!

Ratings and reviews on the App Store help a lot, but I'll never prompt you for in the app.Â I want that to remain a calm, peaceful environment â€”Â you're there to work through negative feelings, after all. If you'd like to leave a review, however, you can open the Settings sheet and tap the **Rate The App** button in the _Get In Touch_ section.

I'll share more about how the launch went in next week's newsletter!

Remember, Thought Detox is on sale at US$0.99 through Sunday, 21 February, and goes to its regular price of US$2.99 on Monday. [Download it on the App Store today!][1]
