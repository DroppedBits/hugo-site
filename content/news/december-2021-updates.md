Welcome back to another edition of Dispatches from Dropped Bits HQ! I hope your holidays were as good as they could be, given All This&trade;.

This month, on top of a quick recap of 2021, I want to talk a bit about where I see Dropped Bits going in 2022. January marks the company's ten-year anniversary â€” something that kinda snuck up on me, if I'm honest. I'd imagined some kind of fanfare, along with a whole new webpage to mark the occasion, and that&hellip; didn't happen.

But nonetheless, here we are, a decade later, still publishing apps on the App Store. That's pretty cool. ðŸ”Ÿ

## December In Review

There was a holiday sale between December 24<sup>th</sup> and January 1<sup>st</sup>, which didn't really move the numbers much from the month before:

- **[Per]**: 5 downloads (last month: 4)
- **[Thought Detox]**: 6 downloads (last month: 6)

Revenues and proceeds on sales are estimates based on the information I get from Apple, in US dollars.

- App Sales (what customers paid Apple): USD$8.98
- App Proceeds (what Apple pays me): USD$7.62

## 2021 In Review

In lieu of the usual App Updates section, I wanted to give an overview of how last year went.

As I mentioned last month, 2021 was a marked change from the first eight years of the company's existence. For one, I actually put a bit more time and effort into marketing, getting write-ups in [iMore] for the launch of Thought Detox, which I announced on [Product Hunt]. I put more intention into cutting unnecessary business expenses, to get me to my goal of breaking even (I will be reviewing this on a quarterly basis going forward, and there are already a couple of new services I plan on cutting).

Total app sales for the business (i.e., what customers paid Apple) amount to USD$336, with app revenues (i.e., what Apple paid me) of USD$274 â€”Â a little more than the 15% App Store cut for small businesses, due to foreign exchange fluctuation, I guess.

Actual cash deposited to my business chequing account was CAD$331, which is interesting: I can pretty much count USD$1 in gross sales as CAD$1 in net revenues. Of course, that will change depending on the USD/CAD foreign exchange rate.

Anyhow, that's all driven by Thought Detox â€”Â primarily, from the launch (USD$178 in proceeds for 127 downloads, or 65% of total proceeds for 2021). Maybe it was silly to set pre-orders at USD$0.99 for a week before launch, though that only really accounted for 31 downloads.

Obviously, this isn't _close_ to the kind of money that can support you, but looking back on the last decade, there was only one other year where I had _any_ net revenues: in 2015, when I launched Per, for a total of USD$2.78.

That's right. App sales in 2021 made 100 times more income than they did for _the rest of the company's existence until then_.

(A note to any iOS developers reading this: marketing works.)
