## My Updates

I wanted to share a couple of updates on [Thought Detox][tdsite] here.

First, a French translation of the app is now being beta tested. I've done the translation myself; my French isn't bad, thanks to immersion programs in high school. Still, it's far from perfect, so if you see something that's off, please let me know.

The French language often uses significantly more words than English to express the same thing, so sometimes that affects UI elements — for example, the "Release Another" button ends up being titled « Libérer une autre pensée » in French. This doesn't fit on one line with the current design of the app, so I'll have to make a change there:

<img alt="A screenshot of Thought Detox after a thought was released, showing the translated title of the 'Release Another' button overflowing onto a second line" src="/images/news/td-french-button.png" style="display: block; max-width: 375px; margin: 0 auto" />

That ties in to the second update: I'm working on some changes to the settings sheet, and part of that will involve moving the seven-day stats out of settings. It doesn't belong there, but I'm not 100% sure what to do with it. I'm toying with the idea of showing that bar chart after you release a thought, right above the "Added X Mindful Minutes" message that you see, but it also needs to be somewhere that can be accessed without having to release a thought. 

As always, you can check out the public roadmap for the app [here][tdroadmap]. Add your suggestions and vote for your favourites!

## Your Updates

What I've learned from my survey on iOS updating habits is that you all tend to not waste any time. That is, updates to your iOS devices are done pretty much immediately. A poll I did on Twitter showed the same behaviour:

`This content is no longer available.`

Now, there are two things wrong with this data. One, it's a _tiny_ sample size, so it's not super reliable. Second, many of my Twitter followers are iOS developers themselves, so they're pretty likely to keep their devices as up-to-date as possible.

Why is this information important? Since Apple releases new features and tools with each new version of iOS, it helps give me an idea of how soon I can drop support for older versions of iOS. So, if you haven't had a chance to participate in the survey, [go here][survey] and fill it out — it's only two questions, and should take less than a couple of minutes!

## One More Thing

I mentioned [last time][perupdate] that I'm in the process of redesigning [Per][persite] from scratch. I'm excited about two things here: working with a [UX designer][csdesign] to better think through how the app should work, and building the thing with the latest [SwiftUI][swiftui] framework announced by Apple in June.
