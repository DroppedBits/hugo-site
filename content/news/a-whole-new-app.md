You may have seen [this tweet][1] yesterday:

`This content is no longer available.`

I've been teasing the work I've been doing on the first new Dropped Bits app sinceâ€¦ wow, 2015? Has it been that long since I launched [Per][2]?

## Thought Detox for iPhone

It's coming, and it's based on [this Glitch app][4] that I built in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm excited to tell you all more about it _soon_, but for now if you're interested in testing the public beta, it's available on [Airport][4] (here's a [direct link][5]).

## One More Thing

You can now subscribe to all the hot Dropped Bits gossip as a newsletter. It's not going to be very active: I intend on writing one post/email, every Wednesday morning (Eastern time), with updates on apps and other stuff related to the business. If you're interested in subscribing, you can sign up for it [here][6].
