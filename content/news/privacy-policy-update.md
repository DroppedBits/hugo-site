In 2019's site update, [analytics were ripped out][1] while I looked for a more privacy-focused option. I'm happy to announce that the site now uses privacy-respecting [Plausible Analytics][2], and I've updated the [privacy policy][3] to reflect this.

> Plausible Analytics is an open-source project dedicated to making web analytics more privacy-friendly. Our mission is to reduce corporate surveillance by providing an alternative web analytics tool which doesnâ€™t come from the AdTech world. ([Source][4])

In the name of transparency, I'm going a step further: site analytics are now publicly available. Go [here][5] to see exactly what data is collected on droppedbits.com.

The change to Dropped Bits' privacy policy is available in its entirety [here][6].
