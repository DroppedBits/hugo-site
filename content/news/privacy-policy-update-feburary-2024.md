Historically, the analytics available in the newsletter provider I use have been disabled. However, I'm seeing a lot of spammy new subscribers, so I've enabled these analytics. The [privacy policy][1] has been updated to reflect this.

I proudly use [Buttondown][2] as my newsletter provider of choice. They're a privacy-focused small business, just like Dropped Bits.

For the sake of completeness, here's what's now tracked in the newsletter, _Dispatches from Dropped Bits HQ_:

- Whether the email sent via Buttondown was received by you
- Whether the email received from Buttondown was opened by you
- What links within the email were clicked

The change to Dropped Bits' privacy policy is available in its entirety [here][3].
