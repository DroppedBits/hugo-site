## Recap: February 2021

Just like last month, most of my time was spent working on launching [Thought Detox on the App Store][tdappstore]. This had a lot more to do with all of the _other_ moving parts, besides the app: the [landing page][thoughtdetox], the marketing copy, the press emails, and the [Product Hunt announcement][producthunt].

Here's what the download numbers looked like for February:

- [HoneyJar][honeyjar]: 9 downloads (-55% ‚ñΩ)
- [Per][per]: 8 downloads (+14% ‚ñ≥)
- [Thought Detox][thoughtdetox]: 127 downloads

Thought Detox is the only paid app; it was available for pre-order at USD$0.99 for one week, then launched on February 15 at the same price; one week later (February 22), it went up to its regular price of US$2.99 ‚Äî¬†making for Dropped Bits' first profitable month in a _long_ time!

Revenues and proceeds on February sales are estimates based on the information I get from Apple, in US Dollars.

- Revenues, February 2021: USD$218 (what customers paid Apple)
- Proceeds, February 2021: USD$178 (what Apple pays me)
- Expenses, February 2021: CAD$129 (approximately USD$103)

Now, this isn't quit-your-job money, but it's still a far better  response to anything I've launched before. [I wrote more about how the launch went here][launchretro].

## Out with the Old

As mentioned in the past few updates, **HoneyJar is no longer available for sale on the App Store**. If you downloaded it prior to March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2021, you can always download it again.

I'll admit that it's been bittersweet. HoneyJar was the first iOS app I ever launched, and I learned a lot from it. I never did much in the way of marketing, and despite that it was still downloaded around 2,800 times. But I don't think it ever really found its way towards product-market fit ‚Äî¬†it provided some interesting visualizations, sure, but beyond that I don't think its value proposition was especially interesting.

As a one-person "team", I've got to be very deliberate about where I focus the scraps of time, energy, and attention that I steal from daily life, and HoneyJar frankly wasn't worth that investment.

## In with the New

On the other hand, **Thought Detox's launch went better than I expected**:

- üì∞ It was included in [Club MacStories][clubmac]' weekly list of "notable app debuts" on February 19<sup>th</sup>
- üì∞ It was featured on [iMore][imore] on February 25<sup>th</sup>
- üì≤ It was downloaded 127 times in two weeks (127 units)
- üöÄ To date, it's got 193 upvotes on [Product Hunt][producthunt] (come on, help me break 200!)
- üëç It got two really great reviews on the App Store, with a total of three 5-star ratings ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

I'll be releasing a new version soon that fixes some bugs and sets the app up for translation to other languages. Check out the [public roadmap][roadmap] to see what I'm working on, and add your own suggestions, thoughts, and votes!
