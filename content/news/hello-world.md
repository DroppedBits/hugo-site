I'm thrilled to announce that—after what feels like an eternity—our first app for iPhone, [HoneyJar](/apps/honeyjar), was submitted on Sunday for approval to the App Store team.

This marks a pretty big milestone, obviously. Dropped Bits incorporated almost three years ago, so it's been a long time coming, too. And it's been an interesting road so far, full of inspiration, hard decisions, learning, sacrifice, and happy little victories.

Turns out, going from idea to shipping your Minimum Viable Product isn't as simple as you'd think—especially when your organization is having an identity crisis.

There's a lot more planned for the future, and I'm really excited about it. I hope you'll find it awesome too.
