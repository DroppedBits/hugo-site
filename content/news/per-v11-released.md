A few little tweaks, enhancements, and bug fixes for you in this new version of Per:

## See all the things

Some view adjustments for iPhone 4s and iPhone 5/5c/5s users now put all the fields on screen, for more happy-tappy UI goodness.

## Globalization, yo

You can now choose the type of non-metric units used in your area (US vs. UK) from the Info page.

## Nuke the site from orbit (it's the only way to be sure)

You can now clear the text from all the fields with one button tap, from the new Clear button (âŠ—) in the keyboard toolbar.

## The tie was a lie

Previously, if you'd tried to compare things where either the price or the units (or both) were zero, Per told you it was a tie. Per spent some time in the corner and thought about what it'd done, and now helpfully tells you instead that you've forgotten to enter a value.

## Squish squash squoosh

We can neither confirm nor deny that bugs were discovered. But if they were, they were fixed.

Per 1.1 is now [available for download on the App Store][download]. And remember: Per will never annoy you for a review, but they really do help. Won't you consider leaving one?
