Our approach to privacy is pretty straightforwardâ€”we avoid collecting private information if we don't have to, and if we do, we respect and protect it.

It's important, however, to consider the difference between private and anonymous data.

## Anonymous data

### Affiliate marketing

We may sometimes use affiliate links to the App Store, known as [the Affiliate Program](http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/faq_en.html). Visiting one of these links will anonymously track purchases you may make on the App Store or iTunes Store, for a 24-hour hour period, on the device that you were using when you opened the link.

You can review the terms and conditions that govern our use of the Affiliate Program [here](http://www.performancehorizon.com/docs/itunes/terms/en.pdf).

## Private data

We do, in some circumstances, collect some personal data.

Specifically, if you send us an e-mail, we'll keep a record of your e-mail address, as well as the communication you had with us, in some form or another. We do this because it's really hard to reply to you without this information, and because whatever comments and questions you have may help us make better products for you.

Additionally, if you post a comment on a news article, whatever information you share will be publicly available to other users of the website, as well as other third parties.

Your e-mail address will never shared be with anyone without your permission. Period.

Well, there's one exception: if we're required by law to share this information, we will, but only after a careful review of the request with our lawyers.

We do not receive any of your information (e.g. name, credit card number, billing address, etc.) from Apple when you make a purchase from the App Store, nor do we have any idea who submits reviews of our apps.

## Living document

This privacy policy is a living document and may change over time to reflect new features and options that we decide to offer (e.g. newsletters, online store, etc.); any time we do so, we'll let you know via the [news page](http://www.droppedbits.com/news/).
